I am a Ph.D. student in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) at Georgia Tech advised by [Prof. Juba Ziani](https://sites.gatech.edu/juba-ziani/).

I am broadly interested in the following research themes: Data privacy (specifically Differential privacy), Mechanism design, Algorithmic fairness, Numerical and Scientific computing, and more! During my Ph.D, I've worked as a Machine Learning intern in the AI team at [Multiscale](https://multiscale.tech/). Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I was a Masters' student in Computational and Data Science at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
